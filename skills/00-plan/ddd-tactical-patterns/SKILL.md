# DDD Tactical Patterns

## Instructions

1. Identify invariants first and design aggregates around them.
2. Model immutable value objects for validated concepts.
3. Keep domain behavior in domain objects, not controllers.
4. Emit domain events for meaningful state transitions.
5. Keep repositories at aggregate root boundaries.



## Example

```typescript
class Order {
  private status: "draft" | "submitted" = "draft";

  submit(itemsCount: number): void {
    if (itemsCount === 0) throw new Error("Order cannot be submitted empty");
    if (this.status !== "draft") throw new Error("Order already submitted");
    this.status = "submitted";
  }
}
```

## Limitations

- This skill does not define deployment architecture.
- It does not choose databases or transport protocols.
- It should be paired with testing patterns for invariant coverage.
